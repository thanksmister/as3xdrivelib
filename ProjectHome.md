This is an ActionScript 3.0 wrapper for the [Open Xdrive JSON API](http://dev.aol.com/api/xdrive). It provides much of the client-side functionality for applications; for example, authentication, uploading files, sharing files, and basic file management.   These functions built the requests with the appropriate JSON payload and decode the responses.  For those of you who may not know, [Open Xdrive](http://plus.xdrive.com) is an online storage service platform (SSP) offered by AOL for storing, managing, sharing, and backing up data. Xdrive offers 5GB of storage for free.  The Open Xdrive JSON API is a way for developers to build applications for this service.
